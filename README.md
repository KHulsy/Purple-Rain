# Purple-Reign-Into-the-Unknown
Abstract: 
I successfully made an API key. I unsuccessfully made two API calls. I was proud when I got the error message. The surface doesn't matter when you can do the code. I can write out function calls and make glittery fonts simultaneously.I can grab info from a website. I'm Ron Burgundy? I did a separate file for pseudo code. I organized my repositories. I have to hand it to Jerome because the portion of my brain dedicated to math also contains my high school bangs and penchant for Big Dog shirts. It's kind of like Mordor up in there. I knew I was going to finish this assignment, fail or not. "I've come too far", she said humbly and unironically. 

Materials/Programs Used: VS Code, Chrome extensions, Bootstrap(Regina George would not like Bootstrap),Json, Jquery, Vanilla Javascript, HTML 5, Google Fonts, openweathermap.org, Monster Energy Drinks, Codeflower.
Acknowledgments: I could be listening to the news in sweats right now, waiting for other people to fix this world. I once again feel like I am an active participant in that process. As we come upon this tenuous fourth of July wherein so much wrong has been enacted, thank you for giving me the opportunity to contribute to a microcosm of betterment. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Jerome.
